    "### The filtering criteria ensured that only relevant papers were included. The citation count threshold (minimum 10 citations) helped focus on well-recognized research, while the authorship limit (max 10 authors per paper) prevented large, collaborative works from dominating the dataset. The subject filter ensured that only papers relevant to Computational Social Science were selected. However, these choices might have excluded emerging research with fewer citations and underrepresented interdisciplinary studies that do not fit neatly into predefined categories."
